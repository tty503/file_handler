# file_handler
Experimental project "object-oriented pseudo-programming" in C. Creation of a "library" for file manipulation.

### For now, we have two modules :
- FILE_HANDLER_STR : for receiving parameters in string. 
- FILE_HANDLER_UCHAR : still under development, designed to receive parameters in ANSII hexadecimal encoding.
